# Skafos Example ML Apps

Today, we are lucky that we have a host of tools and technologies available to accelerate the process of building and using machine learning models. Here at Skafos, we are committed to building a platform that integrates with many of these frameworks, to create the best possible experience for our users. 

In this repository, we are building out example model training workflows and app integrations for different frameworks. Each machine learning model is paired with an app that leverages the Skafos framework to deliver new models to these apps.
