# Skafos Example ML Apps

Today, we are lucky that we have a host of tools and technologies available to accelerate the process of building and delivering machine learning models to mobile apps. Here at Skafos, we are committed to building a platform that integrates with many of these frameworks, to create the best possible experience for our customers.

Unfortunately, because of all these disparate pieces, it can sometimes be challenging to put together an end-to-end machine learning architecture for a specific use case. At Skafos, we are here to help with this process.

In this repository, we are building out example model training workflows and app integrations for different frameworks. Each architecture is paired with an app that leverages the Skafos framework to deliver new models to these apps. This repo is currently under active development, so check back often if you don't see your favorite framework or use case. It is likely to be here soon!

## Supported Frameworks
